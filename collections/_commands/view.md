description: Possible values for slot views are `midi`, `ygg`, `freq`,`ipn`, and `vel` (velocity). `hud`/`h` each reveal a heads up display with column and row numbers. Similarly, reveal or hide phenomenon with `phenomenon`/`p`. `index` is also available to reveal the slot's logical position. Change pages with `tracker`/`t`, `mixer`/`m`, and `clades`/`c` (this can also be accomplished with _tab_). View current sample bank with `bank`/`b`. Toggle sample names with `ypc`.
