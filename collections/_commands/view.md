description: Possible values for slot views are `midi`, `ygg`, `freq`, `vel` (velocity), and `ipn` for notes. `hud`, `h`, and `numbers` each reveal a heads up display with column and row numbers. Similarly, toggle phenomenon with `phenomenon` and `p`. `index` is also available to reveal the slot's position. Change pages with `tracker`/`t`, `mixer`/`m`, and `clades`/`c` (this can also be accomplished with _tab_).
