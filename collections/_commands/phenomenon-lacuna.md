Slot a "lacuna" phenomenon. Lacuna first disables the current track, then enables and queues any other track. The net effect is a clean handoff of one track to another.

Lacunae honor ascending and descending tracks (it is smart enough to start at the top or bottom of a track) but lacunae do not effect solo and mute attributes. Thus, it is possible to queue and and play muted track. This is a feature, not a bug.
