version: v1.0.15

- **NEW** Use the lacuna `@` phenomenon to first disable the current track, then enable and queue any other track. The net effect is a clean handoff of one track to another. Lacunae honor ascending and descending tracks (it is smart enough to start at the top or bottom of a track) but lacunae do not effect solo and mute attributes. Thus, it is possible to queue and and play muted track. This is a feature, not a bug.
- **FIX** Any command specifically targeting a slot deeper than the track will automatically fill the track to that depth.
- **FIX** K3 assignment works again.
- **FIX** Copy and paste tracks works again.
- **DEV** Complete overhaul of the clock architecture to use 96 PPQN. `clock` commands remain the same.
