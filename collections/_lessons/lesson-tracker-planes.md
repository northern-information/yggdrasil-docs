Imagine the tracker with five planes: notes, samples, macros, velocities, and phenomena. With the [view](#view-command-view) command you can toggle each plane on and off.

- Note: stores note data. This can be viewed as IPN, YGG, MIDI, or frequency.
- YPC: stores samples name.
- Macro: stores "macro controls" of the synth. Each synth voice has two macro controls with values that range from 0 - 99.
- Velocity: stores velocity data.
- Phenomena: stores up to one [phenomenon](https://northern-information.github.io/yggdrasil-docs/#glossary-phenomenon).
