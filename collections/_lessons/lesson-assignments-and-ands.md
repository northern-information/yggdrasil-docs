You can assign any arbitrary text to variables. This text can be a fully valid command or a mere fragment... Perhaps a motif like `60;62;65`?

Valid variables are constructed with the dollar sign (`$`) followed by a positive integer.

Once assigned, any command containing these will "expand" the first time you press _&crarr;_.

Chain commands together for rapid execution with `&&`.
