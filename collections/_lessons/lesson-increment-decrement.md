description: Certain selected values can be incremented and decremented with _ctrl_ + _&larr;_ and _&rarr;_. Pressing these keys while holding _shift_ operates at a logical order of magnitude for the given context. For example, in the case of _shift_ + _&rarr;_ when a track is selected, all notes will be transposed up by 12 (an octave).
