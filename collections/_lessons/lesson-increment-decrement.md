description: While in Y Mode, certain selected values can be incremented and decremented with _f_ and _g_. Pressing these keys while holding shift operates at a logical order of magnitude for the given context. For example, in the case of _shift_ + _g_ when a track is selected, all notes will be transposed up by 12 (an octave).
