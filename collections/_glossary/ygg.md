term: ygg Notation
---
ygg notation is like [IPN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_pitch_notation) but faster to type - there are no capitals and the # sign is replaced with \"s\". So C#4 becomes cs4. Yggdrasil saves data in `ygg`. `ygg` is also an acceptable input format for any note command.
