term: YGG Notation
---
YGG notation is like [IPN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_pitch_notation) but faster to type - there are no capitals and the `#` sign is replaced with `s`. So `C#4` becomes `cs4`. Yggdrasil saves data in YGG. YGG is also an acceptable input format for any note command.
